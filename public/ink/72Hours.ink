Grandmother is awake, confused by the darkness.

Hours pass. The storm rages outside.

{has_water:
    You give her water with her medication.
- else:
    You realize you have nothing to drink. The taps don't work without the electric pump.

By morning, grandmother's condition has worsened. She's weak, dehydrated, and needs medical attention.

Within the hour, a rescue coordination vehicle arrives.

The paramedics check on grandmother. "She'll be fine," they say. "You did the right thing calling the right number."

As they help her to the vehicle, you feel a sense of relief.

You were prepared. You paid attention. And when it mattered, you knew exactly what to do.

<b>THE END</b>

<i>You successfully navigated the crisis by preparing well and remembering the correct emergency number: 1247 for rescue coordination.</i>

-> END

=== ending_delayed ===
#CLEAR

Help arrives, but it took longer than it should have.

The paramedics check on grandmother. "She's dehydrated and her blood pressure is concerning," they say. "We need to take her in."

Calling 112 for a non-life-threatening emergency tied up critical resources and delayed your call being processed.

<b>THE END</b>

<i>Remember: 112 is for life-threatening emergencies only. For rescue coordination and non-emergency assistance, call 1247.</i>

You wait. Hours pass.

Eventually, a neighbor with a working car checks on you and takes grandmother to the hospital.

She recovers, but it was close.

If only you had known the right number to call...

<b>THE END</b>

<i>In an emergency, knowing the right numbers can save lives:
• 112 - Life-threatening emergencies
• 1247 - Rescue coordination
• 1343 - Power outage reporting</i>
