Within the hour, a medical team arrives.

They check on grandmother thoroughly. "She's dehydrated but stable," they say. "You did exactly the right thing calling the health advice line."

As they help stabilize her, you feel a sense of relief.

You were prepared. You paid attention. And when it mattered, you knew exactly what to do.

<b>THE END</b>

<i>You successfully navigated the crisis by preparing well and remembering the correct number: 1220 for family doctor and health advice.</i>

-> END

=== ending_partial ===
#CLEAR

Help arrives, though it took a bit longer than necessary.

The rescue team checks on grandmother. "She'll be fine," they say. "Though for medical situations like this, the health advice line 1220 would have been faster. We're mainly handling rescue operations during the storm."

Grandmother is stabilized. You made a reasonable choice, even if not the perfect one.

<b>THE END</b>

<i>You called 1247 (Rescue Coordination) - they helped, but 1220 (Family Doctor / Health Advice) would have been the ideal choice for a medical situation.</i>

-> END

=== ending_delayed ===
#CLEAR

Help arrives, but it took longer than it should have.

The paramedics check on grandmother. "She's dehydrated and her blood pressure is concerning," they say. "We need to take her in."

Calling 112 for a non-life-threatening emergency tied up critical resources and delayed your call being processed.

<b>THE END</b>

<i>Remember: 112 is for life-threatening emergencies only. For health advice and non-emergency medical situations, call 1220.</i>

-> END

#CLEAR

You wait. Hours pass.

Eventually, a neighbor with a working car checks on you and takes grandmother to the hospital.

She recovers, but it was close.

If only you had known the right number to call...

<b>THE END</b>

<i>In an emergency, knowing the right numbers can save lives:
• 112 - Life-threatening emergencies
• 1220 - Family doctor / health advice
• 1247 - Rescue coordination
• 1343 - Power outage reporting</i>
